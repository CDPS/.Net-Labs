**Builder Pattern**

*"Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction proess can create different representations"*

In this example we have the process of constructing a report - Create type section - Create Header Section - Create Content Section - Create Footer Section. On the other we got 2 different representations of the report - (PDF and Excel)
