**Composite Pattern**

*"Compose objects into tree structure to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objetcs uniformly"*

*"Helps you create a tree-like object sctructure using simple and complex objects, all elements share a common interface allowing the client to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. Composite Pattern applies the Open-Closed Principle and you can introduce new elements types into the application without breaking the existing code"*

Example:

In this example we implement a FileSystem Interface, where we can create Directories and Files. See Diagram Bellow:
