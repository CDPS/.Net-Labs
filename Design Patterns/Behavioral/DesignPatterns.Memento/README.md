**Memento Pattern**

*"Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an boject's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later"*

*"Memento lets you save and restore the state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation, to do that this pattern makes full copies of an objectÂ´s state. Memento Pattern delegates the creation of the object's state sanpsshot to the object itself and makes the original object's data safe and secure"*

Example:

In this example we implement and text Editor class wich contains a text area that support undo operations via Memento pattern
