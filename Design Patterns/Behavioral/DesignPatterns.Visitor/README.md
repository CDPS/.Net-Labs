**Visitor Pattern**

*"Represent an opertion to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates"*

*"Using Visitor pattern we can isolate particular behaviors from the objects on wich they operate, and places them in a single class, classes will be more focused on their main jog hence enforcing the Single Responsibility principle, applies the Open-Closed Principle as new visinting behaviors can be easily introduced without modifying existing ones, visitor easily interchangeable by clients at runtime"*

Example:

In this example we implement a Insurance company that has different types of clients (Banks, Companies, Restaurants, etc), and we add new message notification fuctionality depending on the type of the client.
